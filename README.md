# 542_Project
This is the repo for the 542 Project.

## Research Questions
- What types of issues (bugs, feature requests, theoretical questions, etc.) do developers most commonly present to ChatGPT? (Q1)
- Can we identify patterns in the prompts developers use when interacting with ChatGPT, and do these patterns correlate with the success of issue resolution? (Q2)
- How accurately can we predict the length of a conversation with ChatGPT based on the initial prompt and context provided? (Q7)

## Files for each question
- `issue.json` is for Q1
- The combination of `issue.json` and `hacker_news.json` are for Q2
- `20230727_195954_discussion_sharings.json` is for Q7

## Steps for running files
- Clone the entire repository
- Open the `RQ1.ipynb` for Q1 and etc
- If error happens, see if the filename in the code is wrong.

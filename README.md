# 542_Project
This is the repo for the 542 Project.

## Research Questions
- What types of issues (bugs, feature requests, theoretical questions, etc.) do developers most commonly present to ChatGPT? (Q1)
- Can we identify patterns in the prompts developers use when interacting with ChatGPT, and do these patterns correlate with the success of issue resolution? (Q2)
- How accurately can we predict the length of a conversation with ChatGPT based on the initial prompt and context provided? (Q7)

## Files for each question
- `issue.json` is for Q1
- The combination of `issue.json` and `hacker_news.json` are for Q2
- `20230727_195954_discussion_sharings.json` is for Q7

## Steps for running files
- For running all the `ipynb` files, the user will need to pull all the `json` files from the repository as well.
*Therefore, the suggestion will be to clone the entire repository in order to make the files work properly*
- When the repository is being successfully cloned, open the file for each research question, and run the code in the file. After that, the corresponding output should be displayed.
(**If not, try to change the file name if it is incorrect**)
